# Laundry-Bit

An alternative application to circuit laundry that provides a much better experience to the users. A proposed and intuitive user interface for the user to happily experience exceptional services.

## Prerequisites

The circuit laundry (at the time of this writing) has a rating of 1.1/5 stars in both the apple iOS and google App Store. Some of the common complaints include:

1. The users cannot save personal banking information onto the app.
2. There are no functionalities for having a look at previous transactions.
3. No access to in-app digital receipts for each transaction.
4. Users have to pay in a minimum of Â£5 in order to use the services.
5. Bad UI/UX.
6. No third-party authentication systems (Auth0, firebase, etc)


## What is the purpose of the app i want to build?

I want to provide better service to the users, with good UI/UX provided. This will be achieved by reducing cognitive load.

Create a good user story/flow from the point of installation to the end of the service. make it satisfactory.

I want to retain my users.
